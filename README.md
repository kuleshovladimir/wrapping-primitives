In this program, the Navier-Stokes equation is solved.

Input data:
1) wall temperature
2) pressure
3) speed
3) enthalpy

Output data:
1) the dependence of the velocity in the two main directions on the coordinates
2) temperature distribution
3) pressure distribution



To visualize the calculation of the system, the program is used Tecplot
